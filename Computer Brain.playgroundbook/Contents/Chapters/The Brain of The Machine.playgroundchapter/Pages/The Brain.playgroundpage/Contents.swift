 ## **What is a CPU?**
The **Central Process Unit** is the brain of your machine, it's the structure that makes it possible to do anything you wanna do with your device, its brain.
 
 Just like your brain doesn't take up all the space in your body, a CPU occupies very little space in a computer but it runs the show. It's whole job is fetching istructions from memory and executing them. Yep, while you might be typing words on your macbook or your ipad, or even your iphone, the CPU is fetching and executing millions and millions of instructions, every second.
*How can such complex structures be expressed when only registers, memory, and simple three-operand instructions are available in our CPU?*

Since talking about it makes it way more complicaten than it should be, use the interactive view to find out more about how the parts of a computer brain interact to make it "think".

Tap `Run My Code` to show the changes you make.

If you like, when you're done enjoy the *next chapter* where you'll learn how to interact with a CPU using Assembler Languages!
