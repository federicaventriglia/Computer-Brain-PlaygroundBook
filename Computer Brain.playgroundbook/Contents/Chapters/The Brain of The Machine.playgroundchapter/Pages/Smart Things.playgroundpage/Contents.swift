 ## Quizzup!
 Okay now that I've fed you info about how this beautiful brain works let's see if you actually have learned something. I've prepared for you a couple of questions to sum up what we've discussed.
 1. We've learned that almost every smart object has a brain, can you detect which one doesn't?
 2. What about Assembly Instructions? We've learned they follow the basic functions of the CPU elements and combined they allow you to perform more complicated functions.
 3. How does the brain store the data it needs for an operation?
 
 Answer the questions and become the CPU master!
